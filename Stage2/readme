ToDo 
1) Add two more proccessing units 
2) Deal with input registers 
3) Fix minor bugs in proccessing stuff 
4) Finilize the design
5) Produce a more comprahensive test case scenario
6) Define Top-Level better 
7) Update Report accortingly 

Things to consider
1) Top down appoach in presentations
2) Have a more minimalist style with less focus in text
	a.Add table of contents in the middle of the presentation
3) Have better waveforms 
	a.Have more than just simple waveform
	b.Don't display usless data
4) Make the scope a more parallel aproach 
5) Analize things further internally and know more stuff anout our unit
	a.Have a more clear vision about the problem we are solving
	b.Know the internal structure of our modules better 
	c.Know the theory behind the modules and logic better 
	d.Try to predict Sotos comments and or questions
6) Know the tools in more depth 
	a.Play with the tools further and mention its posibilities 
	b.Present extra findings in presentaton and report

The problem we are trying to solve is the massivly parallel data proccessing
this is sovled by having 4 parallel proccessing units. The module design is such 
as to allow the easy expantion to more proccessing modules as we see fit.
